# webscraper

A web scraper that searches for the latest software engineering/developer job listings.

This webscraper is of basic function, scraping data from one specific website.
The website's robots.txt ext has been checked and the .py program is ethical as of 13 Apr 2023.

The output of the file is currently considered messy.
Updates will be provided in future as my programming experience increases such that I can tidy the output text.

The webscraper also has a flaw such that it will not print job listings older than 4 hours. The function calls that any int value over 4 within the post age, for example "5 hours old", or "5 days old", will not be printed. In future versions of this webscraper, this will be fixed.
